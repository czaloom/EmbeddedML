# EmbeddedML
### A Neural Network Library for Embedded "Edge" Devices

**EmbeddedML** was created to be an alternative to the limited options available for Artificial Neural Networks in C. It is meant to support students design learning capabable "edge" devices. The library is built to be expandable and straightforward to manipulate.
  
## EXAMPLES

### GETTING STARTED 
  - Two examples are provided to show how a simple application could use embeddedML in a learning task.
  	* XOR 
  	* XOR-AND 

For those experienced with SensorTile and the STMicroelectronics Datalog project...

### STM SensorTile
  - Learning Orientation Based on Accelerometer Data
      * [Video](https://youtu.be/phoKZ6RlKD0) of performance on STM's SensorTile 
  - Learning the XOR-AND Gate

The examples are complete EmbeddedML applications demonstrating training and testing EmbeddedML operation.

Now, for those **learning about SensorTile** please see the information below:
